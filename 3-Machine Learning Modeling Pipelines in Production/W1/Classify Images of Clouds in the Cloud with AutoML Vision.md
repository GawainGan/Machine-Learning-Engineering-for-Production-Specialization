Classify Images of Clouds in the Cloud with AutoML Vision

In this assignment, you will train and deploy a model using the Cloud AutoML API. More concretely, you will:

1. Upload a labeled dataset to Cloud Storage.
2. Connect the dataset to AutoML Vision with a CSV label file.
3. Train a model with AutoML Vision.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the model.
5. Generate predictions on the trained model

Here is the recorded video for the whole process:
